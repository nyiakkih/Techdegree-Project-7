# Techdegree-Project-7
 Musical Analysis

This project involved combining datasets of the top Spotify songs from 2010 to 2019 into a single dataset, performing data cleaning and analysis using Python and Pandas. I explored various aspects of the dataset, including correlations between song attributes, identifying the most popular genre, and determining the year with the highest amount of spoken word in songs. Finally, I exported the combined dataset into a CSV file named "top_spotify_songs.csv".
